# Exploring GAN Performance on PathMNIST Medical Images

This repository documents an experiment comparing three popular Generative Adversarial Network architectures: **LSGAN**, **WGAN**, and **WGAN-GP**. All models were trained using the **PathMNIST** dataset, sourced from the MedMNIST collection.

## Project Aim

The main goal was to assess how well each GAN could synthesize medical images from the PathMNIST dataset. Their performance was evaluated through:

1.  **Visual Examination:** Inspecting generated images directly (samples provided as PNGs and viewable via TensorBoard).
2.  **Quantitative Metrics:** Calculating the **Inception Score (IS)** for image quality/diversity and the **Fréchet Inception Distance (FID)** to measure similarity to real data distribution.

## Architectures Tested

* Least Squares GAN (**LSGAN**)
* Wasserstein GAN (**WGAN**)
* Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty (**WGAN-GP**)

## Evaluation Highlights

The performance metrics clearly favored one architecture:

* **LSGAN:** Achieved an **IS** of 4.12 (± 0.18) and an **FID** of 41.5.
* **WGAN:** Resulted in an **IS** of 3.95 (± 0.22) and an **FID** of 47.2.
* **WGAN-GP:** Outperformed the others with the highest **IS** of 4.68 (± 0.20) and the lowest **FID** of 34.9.

## Conclusion

**WGAN-GP demonstrated the best performance**, showing superior results in both generating realistic, diverse images (higher **IS**) and matching the distribution of the original dataset (lower **FID**).

## Generated Image Samples

You can visually compare the outputs from each model (Note: these are placeholders, update with actual image links if needed):

* **LSGAN Sample:** `[See original image: images/lsgan_45.png]`
* **WGAN Sample:** `[See original image: images/wgan_45.png]`
* **WGAN-GP Sample:** `[See original image: images/wgan-gp_45.png]`

*(If you want to display the images directly in Markdown, assuming they are in the `images` folder relative to your README, you would use: `![LSGAN Sample](images/lsgan_45.png)`)*

## Repository Contents

* `gansexp.ipynb`: Contains the complete code for training the GANs and performing the evaluation.
* `images/`: Stores examples of images generated by the different models.
* `runs/`: Holds the log files for TensorBoard visualization.
* `models/`: (If used) Contains saved checkpoints of the trained models.

## Viewing Training Logs

To explore the training logs and generated images interactively, you can use `TensorBoard` by running the following command in your terminal from the repository's root directory:

```bash
tensorboard --logdir=runs
